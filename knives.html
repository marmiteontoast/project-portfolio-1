    <div class="img-gyuto img-styling"></div>
    <p class="paragraph-styling">The Gyuto (cow knife) is the eastern equivalent of the western chefs knife. Best used for cutting vegetables and 
        butting into meat. Compared to it's western counter part it doesn't have such a pronounced 'belly', so if your into the rock cutting technique your out of luck. 
        You'll need to adopt a thrust-ctutting technique to effectively use the knife well.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="paragraph-styling">These knives start from 160mm all the way up to 270mm making the style of knife one of, if not the the most, versitile knife around.
        great pull-cutting softer meatsas well as push-cutting more muscular cuts of meats. With it's very thin profile.Being 
        papar thin vegetables are made easy.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph-styling">If your looking for one knife that can do all tasks you won't be disapointed with this knife. </p>
    
    <div class="img-santoku img-styling"></div>
    <p class="paragraph-styling">The santoku (three virtues) orginally used for vegetables and fish but is now considered very effective at cutting into meat as well. 
        before the Japanese created the gyuto for the western market the santoku was used  in the professional kitshen by Japanese steal enthusiast.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph-styling">The knife has a fairly straight profile Compared to the gyuto as well as a shorter tip. 
        Because of it's flatter profile it places your wrist in a more neutral position allowing not raise one's shoulder as gigh.
        A possible choice for anyone with shoulder/back issues. These knifes start from 165mm - 180mm making them a good size for most house holds.
        Best used with an up and  down chopping motion rather than a 'rocking' cut.
    </p>
    <div class="img-nakiri img-styling"></div>
    <p class="paragraph-styling">The nakiri (vegetable knife), if your serious about your vegetables you'll need this in your arsenal. The profile resembles that that of a small clever.
        It has a uniform blade length from the butt of the knife to the top. As the name suggetst it's primarily for vegetable prep, so no need for a pointed tip.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph-styling">The knife's square like prfile gives it more weight the most knives allowing greater downward force when cutting through dense products.
        There is no 'belly' on this knife, so the knife makes full  contact with the cutting surface guarnteeing the product is cut all the way through.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph-styling">Typical size for 165mm - 180mm but there are some smiths which produce longer ones. Most people who purchase santoku also grab one of These.</p>
    <div class="img-petty-parry img-styling"></div>
    <p class="paragraph-styling">The petty/parry is a small utility knife which most gyuto users grab to complement their collection. Used for detailed in-hand knife work and to cut small pieces of food. The general size range is 120mm-180mm they run much longer than a standard paring knife.
        my opinion it's inappropriate to call it a parry but it's also true there is no fixed size for a petty knife. 
        most cooks prefer this compared to it's western counter-part. 
    </p>
    <div class="img-honesuki img-styling"></div>
    <p class="paragraph-styling">The Honesuki (boning knife) is a style of boning knife which excels at deboning large cuts of meat filleting fish and does very well with poultry.
        the 'spine' of the blade is thick relative to most Japanese knives for the purpose of separating meat from bone. These knives are typically asymetrical meaning the blaade is single beveled, but you can buy ones that are double too.
        Understand, it's not to cut through bone but is ideal for cutting through cartilage and tendons.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph-styling">These knives don't exceed 165mm so some us them as utility knives instead of the standard petty/parry.</p>
    <div class="img-sujihiki img-styling"></div>
    <p class="paragraph-styling">The sujihiki (flesh Cutter) is primarily used to cut through boneless poultry but can just as easily be used for fish as well. The rather long blade length gives you the ability to slice trough protein
         in a single stroke instead of sliding back and forth in a sawing motion. with this knife you can obtain ultra thin cuts of meat, fish or poultry.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph-styling">A sujihiki is commonly 240mm in length making it a great choice for home kitchens, for sliciing birds or small roats.</p>
