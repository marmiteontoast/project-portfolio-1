                    sharpening is a fun thing to do. While some love 
                    to cook, there are others who enjoy sharpening their kitchen knives. 
                    It feels amazing to use a knife that you have sharpened yourself.</p>

                <h4>You save money</h4>
                <P>Sure, buying the materials needed can be an expensive, but what about sending your knvies in to be sharpened?

                <h3>Mark John</h3>
                <br>
                <p>James was a great teacher. You can see he's very knowledgeable about knives and passionage about what he does. </p>
                <p>They have all the tools and equipment there, but you can bring your own stones and knife if you want; but I chose not to.</p>
                <p>James made it quiet simpe to understand. Really, you do not need the whole 90mins it only takes 10 to grasp the technique.</p>

                <h3>John Sidwell</h3>
                <br>
                <p>I started to teach myself with free sharpening tutorials online (The youtube channel "burrfection" is really good).
                    But i had problems with maintaining the sharpening angle and knowing what angle i should choose. I decided to join  this class and 
                in a few short minutes i learned how to hold the knife properly and know my angles are consistent</p>

                <h3>Chris c.</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The class was fun, informative and educational. They gave the basics of different kinds of steels, verious whetstone grits and when they should be used.
                     The instructor was good at providing guidence and feedback throughout the class. Time flew by and I really learned a lot 
                     - the only regret is I didn't do this class sooner! </p>

                <h3>bob b.</h3>
                <br>
                <p>After years of trying on my own and getting nowhere, I decided to learn from someone that knows what they're doing.
                    They explained what happens when a knife gets dull and the process of creating a new edge. 
                    All equipment is provided for you but I brought my own stones and knife. you learn a skill which you will have for a life time. I consider that money well spent.

                <h3>Dan Peterson</h3>
                <br>
                <p>A Nice set up, the class composition was perfect as it allowed for individual attention to students if required. 
                    The instructor explained stones, knife profiles and which techniques shoud be used to provide the best results.Their was detailed information with regard to the accessories used in knife sharpening. 
                    They let you practice on three different knives in various stages of sharpening I found this particular part of the lesson insightful.</p>

                <br>
                <p>i loved this class the instructors are all so approachable and more than happy to answer your questions.
                    There teaching method was so easy to understand. they broke it down to one simple thing "form a burr remove the burr";
                they instructed us on the most used grit levels and what they would recommend for a person buying a whetstone for the first time.</p>
