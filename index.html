                    sharpening is a fun thing to do. While some love 
                    to cook, there are others who enjoy sharpening their kitchen knives. 
                    It feels amazing to use a knife you have sharpened yourself.</p>
                <h4>know your knife</h4>
                <p>You'll form a special connection with your knife. 
                    Discovering your knife's specific character, the shape of it's edge and how hard or soft the steel is.</p>
                <h4>You save money</h4>
                <P>Sure buying the materials needed can be an investment. But what about sending your knvies in to be sharpened?

                <p>James was a great teacher  you can see his very knowledgeable about knives, and passionage about what he does. </p>
                <p>They have all the tools and equipment there but you can bring your own stones and knife if you want, but i chose not to.</p>
                <p>James made it quiet simpe to understand. really, you don't need the whole 90mins it only takes 10 grasp the technique.</p>

                <br>
                <p>i started to teach myself with free sharpening tutorials online, youtube channel "burfection" is really good.
                    But i had problems with maintaining the sharpening angle and knowing what angle i should choose.
                in a few short minutes i learned how to hold the knife properly and know my angle is consistent</p>

                <br>
                <p>The class was fun, informative and educational. they gave the basics of different kinds of steels, verious whet stone grits and when they should be used.
                     they instructor was good at providing guidence and feedback throughout the class. time flew by and i really learned a lot 
                     - the only regret is a didn't do this class sooner </p>

                <h3>bob b.</h3>
                <br>
                <p>after years of trying on my own and getting nowhere i decided to learn from someone that knows what there doing.
                    they explained what happens when a knife gets dull and the process of creating a new edge. 
                    all equipment is provided for you but i brought my own stones and knife. you learn a skill which you will have for a life time on consider that money well spent.

                <p>nice set up with just the right amount of people for a class and still focus on every individual student. 
                    The instructor explained stones knife profiles and what techniques to get the best results -he even spoke about accessories as well.
                they let you practice on three different knives in verious stages of sharpening, i found this particular part of the lesson insightful.</p>

                <h3>rachel s.</h3>
                <p>i loved this class the instructors are all so approachable and more than happy to answer your questions.
                    there teaching method was so easy to understand, them breaking it down to one simple thing "form a burr remove the burr"
                they instructed us on the most used grit levels and what they would recommend for a person buying a whetstone for the first time.</p>
