# Testing

 - I have tested the site and it works on browsers: Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
 - I confirmed the site is responsive, looks great and functions on all current screen sizes using dev tools.
 - I confirmed all nav and social links function properly, and contact info is readable and clear to understand.
 - I have confirmed the form on the sign up page works: requires correct entries in all fields, will only accept first name, sir name, email address and the class you prefer. 

 ## bugs

### solved bugs:

 - when i reduced the screen size the the times section would create overflow passing through the footer.
 - I discovered it was the ul selector specifically "position: fixed", that was affecting all ul's on my index page.
    
  <h2><img src="assets/css/images/slack-screenshot.png"></h2>

- removal of attribute fixed this as well as giving nav and footer elements separate ids.
